            <p>This is my official portfoloio website to showcase my skills and projects.
                I am a computer science engineering student who is extremely motivated, eager and has a passion for
                coding
                As a student, I'm honing my expertise in web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as
                well as
                programming languages like C++ and Python.

                <p>

                    I've worked on a number of projects during my academic career that have helped me gain experience
                    using what I've learned to solve challenges in the real world. Also, I've taken part in hackathons
                    and code challenges, which have improved my capacity for quick thinking under pressure and
                    successful teamwork.
                    As a CSE student, I am always interested in finding out about cutting-edge research and emerging
                    technologies. I'm also curious about how computer science intersects with other disciplines like
                    data science, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence.

                    In addition to my technical abilities, my participation in extracurricular activities has helped me
                    to develop excellent leadership and communication abilities. I've planned a number of events and
                    taken part in community service initiatives as a member of the AARUSH CREATIVES and NGAI ROBOTICS
                    clubs.
                    I'm eager to learn more about career options in the tech sector, and I'm interested in internships
                    and entry-level jobs that will let me use my knowledge and skills to solve problems in the real
                    world.

                        regarding the technology sector.</span>
